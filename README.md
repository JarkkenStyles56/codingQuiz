# codingQuiz

Objective of this Homework is to make create a web application in the form of a multiple choice quiz about JavaScript.
In order to do this, I decide to use a class constructor to make the javascript a lot simpler to look at. Being able to change from one object to the next without having to create arrays for each element of my quiz (Questions, possible answers, correct answers, etc.) and then having to select each of the correct "i" in each array. Now all of that is stored within and updates with each new object.

## I will be inserting a gif here of how my web app works when I'm done. Thank you to the grader of HW3 for showing me how to do so.
